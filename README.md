## Create-O365CheckpointObjects
Create the required objects (IPv4, IPv6 addresses, URLs) in a Checkpoint R80+ management server to allow Office 365 traffic

It depends on the ConvertFrom-O365AddressesXMLFile module (https://github.com/it-praktyk/Conver...dressesXMLFile). So you need to install it first.
